    Throughout my 8 years at the company I was solely responsible for the maintenance and development of the Android and iOS apps, which included an integration with Brother label printers. My duties also included supporting the customer support with queries and bug fixes. 

    Before taking on my senior role at ChurchSuite I had already been involved in major projects such as; rebuilding the mobile apps and the foundations of a bookings module. At this time we used a KANBAN type of agile development, possible due to the company size at the time.

    As a senior developer I led many projects including; the building of the bookings module, unlimited dynamic custom fields for models, smart tags which collate models such as people based on certain criteria, PHPUnit test suites, rewriting the routing and authentication logic, a serverless Laravel based system for embedding content in websites, and many more.

    We used the Basecamp Shape Up methodology for cycle development, which I fully recommend for any sized development team.

    In this post I shadowed a business analyst manager and worked on my own project to find and capture legacy reports for a solution that the business was migrating to. It was a great opportunity to work with many senior managers within the company.
