about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  A passionate software developer with a particular flair for back-end development refactoring old/legacy systems and writing unit/integration tests. With over 10 years of industry experience I am always aware of new and upcoming ways to improve our coding practices, no code is perfect and documentation can always be improved.

  I strongly believe in a team based work ethic, whereby any idea is worth hearing and responsibility should never rest on one person alone. When it comes to project management I have found that the [Shape Up methodology by Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup){:target="_blank"} is; the most innovative, prevents burn-out and increases project excitement in the team. An advocate for equality in the workplace for all and keen to develop new connections.

  Hobbies and interests include; board games, all things star wars, dog walking, hiking and playing around with new technology or coding languages/practices in my spare time. I really love to travel and have been to over 30 countries in Europe to date.
